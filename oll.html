                    <p>"One Last Look" was a collaborative project created as part of a class at NYU Shanghai. Given the task to create a unique game using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4), our team chose to challenge the rapid deconstruction of traditional neighborhoods in Shanghai and Beijing. To do this, we went to a neighborhood within Xintiandi and took over 1,000 to create a composite scan of the apartment's exterior wall, including features that are quitessentially associated with this type of neighborhood. Within the game itself, I worked with UE4's "destructible mesh" feature to create an effect of rubble which would fall as the player moves forward throughout the game. By the time the player reaches the end of the game, the alley they look back through is no longer accessible and is covered in rubble. The action for the player to move backwards has been disabled, meaning the player can only move forward, inevitably leading them to the end of this neighborhood.</p>

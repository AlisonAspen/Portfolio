                    <p>Hi there! I am currently a junior at NYU Shanghai, but will be based out of New York for the spring of 2020. My areas of study are Interactive Media Arts, Computer Science, and Chinese language. Much of my practice involves blurring the lines between art and technology. I have worked on multiple Virtual Reality environments, both for personal and professional experience. For 3D modeling, I tend to focus on artistic boundaries capable through the technique of photogrammetry, though I have worked with softwares such as AutoCAD for manipulation of models.
